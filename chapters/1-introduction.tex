\chapter{Introduction}

Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is an important tool in many areas, including medical, food industry and earth observation \cite{ientilucciAtmosphericCompensationHyperspectral2019}. With the advent of small satellite technology, the availability of space remote sensing, including HSI, has increased \cite{parenteSpecialIssueHyperspectral2019}. This places a higher demand on the development of efficient hardware, sensors and algorithms for the acquisition and processing of such data. This document gives an overview of the state-of-the-art for one such algorithm for processing of HSIs, namely the CCSDS-123.0-B-2 compression algorithm. The focus will be on its implementation for high throughput hardware accelerators, where available logic resources are limited.
